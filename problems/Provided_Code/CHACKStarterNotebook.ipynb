This notebook template will help you get the data loaded into google colab - its a bit tricky. The CHACKutils module contains two functions that will make working with the provided data easier. One function, called 'dataLoader', will help you load the csv files in the correct format. The second, called 'getTaxonomicLevelData', will compile the bacterial abundance data at the taxonomic level of your choice and is mainly intended to be used by teams working on project 2. Read their docstrings by hovering your cursor over the function name after writing it in a code cell.\n","\n","## Set up google Drive filepaths and import helper code\n","\n","Before we get started, we need to set up the google drive filepath for the colab notebook. Note that it is bad form not to import everything at the top of the notebook, but we need to do it this way in colab. See the following videos for a walkthrough of how we get set up and how we use outside files, such as modules: [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rZn-aVNR0A), [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2z3tFPbwjA)\n","\n","First, Mount your google drive like we did in the tutorials:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e4621073","metadata":{"id":"e4621073"},"outputs":[],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Next, you will change the directory (or folder - same thing) of the notebook into the directory where the CHACKutils.py file and the data .csv files are stored.
